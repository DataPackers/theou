# Theou
## A DataPack made for DataPack Jam #2

Theou adds the dimension of Olympia, the realm of the Ancient Greek Gods.  
Explore the unique biomes based on Ancient Greek mythology, and complete tasks given by the gods, in order to gain their blessings.  

Minecraft 1.19+ is required.

## Guide
To get started on your journey with Theou, you will need to find an Oracle.

Oracles will generate around your world, and will always emit a mysterious glow...

Throwing a Diamond Block, as a sacrifice, to the Oracle, will grant you a Task from the Gods.  
Right click on the task to accept it.

When you complete a task, you will be granted a favour.  
Sacrificing three favours to the Oracle will open a portal to Olympia.  
Make sure you get in fast! It only stays open for a minute and a half!

You will arrive high in the sky, in Olympia!  
Make sure you guide yourself safely to land!  
Once you have arrived, you will then be able to explore to your hearts content!  
Can you discover all five of the unique biomes?

### Blessings of the Gods
In Olympia, you will be able to find Temples, dedicated to the many different Gods of Olympia.

Offering a God's favour to the flames in their Temple will grant you a Blessing.  
You can tell which Temple belongs to which God, by the coloured concrete on it's roof.  
The name of the Favour is coloured the same as it's God.

Around Olympia, there are many more structures to explore, and great treasures to be found!

When you are ready to leave Olympia, simply jump into the void! Don't worry, it's safe!

## Spoilers
It is recommended that you explore and experiment around with Theou, to discover how it all works!  
However, if you are stuck, or don't have the time to fully explore the world, useful details will be listed below.  

### Table of Gods
| God | Task | Blessing | Colour |
| --- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Aphrodite | Breed 10 Animals | Regeneration (to self) + Slowness (to others) | Pink |
| Apollo | Sacrifice Cat music disc | Infinite Spectral Arrows | Blue |
| Ares | Kill 25 Zombies | Strength + Resistance | Red |

Sacrifices are made by throwing the required items one at a time into the Oracle's pool.

Blessings will randomly degrade with use. However, the degradation is global for all blessings.  
The degradation goes down over time, if not using blessings.  
To use a blessing, hold it in either your main or off hand.
